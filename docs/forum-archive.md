## Leo's Original Post (Thread Starter)

While there is a very long thread in full range regarding DML speakers, I think they are also very interesting for PA applications, and deserve their own thread since it is quite a different application then when making a pair of speakers for home use.

### Why DML is Interesting for PA Sound

1. **SPL does not reduce as much over distance.** This means a more even spread of the sound over the audience. The decay rate is more like a line array even if you have a single plate set up as a point source. Basically if you stand on a dancefloor with plates directed to the middle from each corner, it feels like the stacks are half the distance away compare to where they actually are.

2. **The diffuse waves help with acoustic issues.** Not only by reducing the amount of reflections we perceive in a closed space, but also the interference between multiple speakers. The whole dancefloor sounds like a sweet spot with both loud and clear sound.

3. **Dispersion is really wide**, covering a lot of area with a few speakers.

4. **Good sensitivity**, even when looking at the usual on axis response, and amazing total efficiency when taking the dispersion into account.

5. **Low distortion** even at high SPL.

6. **Excellent spatial imaging** despite the diffuse nature. Even when standing very close to one speaker stack you can hear stereo effects from speakers on the other side of the dancefloor.

## Leo's System Specs

### Current Setup (2026)
- **Exciters:** Xcite XBT40 and XT25
- **Amps:** Morin brand GaN (rack-mounted)
- **Processor:** Linea Research
- **Printed parts:** Bio-friendly carbon enhanced filament (handles 165°C)

### Product Options (planned)
**Passive speakers:**
- Any amp + DSP of user's choice

**Active speakers:**
- Amp modules: Connex IRS2200SMPS or ICEpower 200AS2
- Plus small DSP chip

### Original Festival Setup (2022, 200 people, 20x20m dancefloor)
- **4 stacks, 4 plates per stack = 16 plates total**
- **Plates:** Graphite enhanced EPS (GPS/Neopor), 500x330x25mm
  - Source: dekokopf.com (German supplier)
- **Exciters:** 4x DAEX30HESF-4 per plate (Dayton Audio)
  - Wired series-parallel for 4 ohm per plate
  - Total 640w RMS per stack
- **Amps:** Sanway D2S 2CH 900W DSP plate amps
  - 500w per channel @ 8 ohm, 900w @ 4 ohm
- **Subs:** 4x L'Acoustics SB218 (rented)
- **Crossover:** 90Hz (plates roll off naturally at 100Hz)

### Plate Construction
- 3D printed corners hold two frames that clamp GPS plate
- Adhesive foam strips for suspension
- Exciters fixed with epoxy in Tectonic-like configuration
- Coating: Hide glue (3:1 water to granules) + thin shellac layer

### Cost Comparison
- Leo's plates: ~€200 per speaker
- Quality line array speaker: Several €K
- Tectonic DML500: Premium pricing, US-only, import to EU very costly

## Party Feedback (Verbatim)

> "We turned it on and without even tweaking the XO it just was way beyond expectation, sounding really loud and clear, and no problem to keep up with the subs, rather the other way around. Sound guy admitted he was very sceptical initially, and probably thought I was crazy not using his Kara tops instead, but admitted he was very impressed when he heard it."

> "During the party I just got constant comments about the sound. Everyone positive, and lots of people that would never do that usually. The actual sound geeks present was over the top ecstatic."

### Common Comments:
- "everywhere seems like a sweet spot"
- "I always have to wear earplugs, but not with this sound"
- "best sound I have ever heard"
- "it is like listening to quality headphones but from a PA system"

## Technical Notes

### Frequency Response
- Expect ~10dB swings, especially in lower mids
- ~6dB HF rolloff overall
- Responds well to EQ
- Much lower harmonic distortion than conventional speakers (tested against Tannoy Reveal 802)

### Materials Tested
- GPS (graphite EPS) — slightly tighter than regular EPS, very efficient
- Carbon/nomex honeycomb — more expensive, may not be worth it
- Paper/EPS sandwich — great FR but too fragile for PA use
- Pure carbon boards — too stiff, poor efficiency

### Key Insights
- DML doesn't really apply to sub frequencies (already omnidirectional)
- Small plates (500x330mm) can go down to ~100Hz
- Diffuse sound makes crossover phase less problematic
- Dipole pattern gives impression of more treble at distance
- Panel coating (hide glue + shellac) improves sensitivity and sound

## Market Context

### Tectonic (only commercial DML PA manufacturer)
- High quality, premium price
- Only in US, very costly to import to EU
- Claims one DML500 can replace 8-16 line array speakers
- Target: big established rental firms (conservative, want familiar products)

### The Gap
> "In the end, with nothing else on the market, no one hears DML systems and no one demands them from the rental firms. So it seems to be up to DIY'ers to build some systems and get the word around!"

## Other Contributors' Experiments

### Andre Bellwood (South Africa)
- 20mm EPS with paper skins
- 460x770mm panels
- Polycarb disc technique for HF boost (100mm disc behind 105mm hole)
- Achieved very flat FR
- ~99dB/W sensitivity per panel
- Potential 119dB @ 300W peak

### Polycarb Disc Technique
- Lighter disc moves at higher frequencies
- Panel coupled via hot glue "legs" handles lower frequencies
- Acts like 2-way mechanical system without electrical crossover
