                It started with a prototype and a party.
            </p>
            <p>
                What began as curiosity about distributed mode loudspeakers turned 
                into something unexpected. After building a few prototypes and testing 
                them at underground parties, the feedback was overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sound engineers who'd worked hundreds of festivals said it was the 
                best they'd ever heard. People who always needed earplugs were 
                dancing for hours without fatigue. Conversations were happening 
                next to the speakers — at volume.
            </p>
            <p>
                The technology isn't new. DML has been around for decades. But it's 
                been stuck in niche applications, held back by patents and proprietary 
                implementations that never quite delivered on the promise.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
                We think it's time to change that.

                Resonant Systems is building open, accessible DML speaker systems 
                designed for the DIY community. No patents, no gatekeeping. Just 
                great sound technology that anyone can build.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-8 text-center">Why DIY?</h2>

            <p>
                The pro audio market is resistant to new technology. Manufacturers 
                don't want to explain something unfamiliar to customers. Previous 
                attempts to commercialize DML for professional use haven't succeeded.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the DIY sound system community? They're experimenters. They're 
                builders. They care about sound quality over brand names. They're 
                the perfect people to prove what DML can do.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">
                Build it. Play it at your parties. Let people hear the difference. 
                That's how this technology spreads — from the ground up.
