# What is DML?

## A Different Way to Make Sound

Traditional speakers work like pistons. A cone moves back and forth, pushing air in a focused beam. Stand directly in front: great sound. Move to the side or back: it falls apart.

**Distributed Mode Loudspeakers (DML)** flip this completely.

Instead of a piston, a DML uses an *exciter* attached to a large, lightweight panel. The exciter induces vibrations that spread across the entire surface. The panel doesn't push air — it *radiates* sound from thousands of points simultaneously.

The result is fundamentally different from anything you've heard from a conventional speaker stack.

## How It Works

A DML system has two components:

1. **Exciter** — A motor without a cone. It translates electrical signal into mechanical vibration.
2. **Panel** — A rigid, lightweight surface (foam board, graphite EPS, honeycomb composites). The panel becomes the radiating element.

When the exciter fires, it creates complex bending waves across the panel surface. These waves interact, creating what acousticians call "distributed modes." Rather than fighting these resonances (like traditional speaker designers do), DML embraces them.

The chaotic interference patterns produce remarkably even frequency response and truly omnidirectional coverage.

## Why DML Sounds Better for PA

### 1. The Whole Dancefloor is the Sweet Spot

With traditional speakers, SPL drops rapidly as you move away from the stack. DML maintains level across distance — more like a line array, even from a single panel.

> "Basically if you stand on a dancefloor with plates directed to the middle from each corner, it feels like the stacks are half the distance away compared to where they actually are."

### 2. Diffuse Waves Solve Acoustic Problems

In real venues, reflections and interference between multiple speakers create dead spots and harsh build-ups. DML's diffuse radiation reduces perceived reflections and smooths out multi-speaker interference.

### 3. Massive Dispersion

A single DML panel covers a much wider area than a conventional driver. Fewer speakers needed. Less gear to haul.

### 4. Lower Distortion at High SPL

Even pushed hard, DML maintains clarity. Testing against conventional studio monitors shows significantly lower harmonic distortion from DML panels.

### 5. Excellent Stereo Imaging

Despite the diffuse nature, stereo remains coherent. Even standing right next to one stack, you can still hear spatial effects from speakers across the room.

## DML vs. Traditional Speakers

| Aspect | Traditional PA | DML Panels |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Sweet spot | Narrow, on-axis | Everywhere |
| SPL over distance | Drops quickly (inverse square) | Maintains (line-source-like) |
| Coverage angle | 60-90° typical | Near-hemispherical |
| Multi-speaker interference | Significant | Reduced |
| Weight | Heavy cabinets | Lightweight panels |
| Distortion at volume | Increases | Stays low |
| Cost per coverage area | High | Low |

## Technical Details

### Panel Materials We've Tested

- **GPS (Graphite Enhanced EPS):** Slightly denser than regular foam, excellent efficiency. Our go-to for PA use.
- **Carbon/Nomex Honeycomb:** Premium option, more expensive, marginal improvement.
- **Paper/EPS Sandwich:** Beautiful frequency response, too fragile for transport.
- **Pure Carbon Boards:** Too stiff, poor efficiency.

### Exciter Configurations

- Small plates (500×330mm) reach down to ~100Hz before natural rolloff
- 4× exciters per panel in series-parallel for 4Ω impedance
- Crossover to subs around 90Hz

### Panel Treatment

- **Coating:** Hide glue (3:1 water to granules) + thin shellac layer
- Improves sensitivity and tightens sound
- Adhesive foam strips for suspension and decoupling

### Frequency Response Notes

Expect ~10dB swings in raw response, especially lower mids. ~6dB HF rolloff overall. But DML responds beautifully to EQ — the underlying distortion is so low that you can push correction without artifacts.

## The Physics (For the Curious)

DML doesn't behave like a point source or a line source. It's something else.

When a panel vibrates, each point on its surface radiates sound. These points are out of phase with each other in complex, frequency-dependent ways. At low frequencies, the panel acts more like a dipole. At high frequencies, thousands of tiny sources fire in pseudo-random phase relationships.

This "modal chaos" is actually the magic. It's why there's no single sweet spot — the sound field is inherently diffuse. It's why SPL doesn't drop as fast — the radiation pattern doesn't concentrate energy the way a cone does.

Traditional speaker design fights resonance. DML rides it.

## Not for Everything

DML doesn't replace subwoofers — below ~100Hz, you want conventional subs. Bass is already omnidirectional; DML's benefits don't apply there.

DML also isn't chasing "studio accuracy." It's optimized for fill, coverage, and immersive experience. For mixing and mastering, use monitors. For making a dancefloor feel alive? That's where DML shines.
