# Resonant Systems — Home Page Draft

## Hero Section

# The whole dancefloor is the sweet spot.

We build open-source DML speaker systems for parties, festivals, and live events. 

No more fighting for the spot in front of the stack. No more blown-out treble up close and muffled bass in the back. Just clear, loud, immersive sound — everywhere.

## What We Do

Resonant Systems designs distributed mode loudspeaker (DML) systems optimized for PA use. Unlike traditional cone speakers that push sound in one direction, our panels radiate from their entire surface — filling spaces evenly without the typical drop-off.

**The result?** People at the back hear the same quality as people at the front. Dancers can spread across the floor without clustering around the stacks. Sound engineers get fewer complaints and more compliments.

> "During the party I just got constant comments about the sound. Everyone positive, and lots of people that would never do that usually. The actual sound geeks present was over the top ecstatic."

## Why DML for PA?

| Traditional PA | DML Systems |
|----------------|-------------|
| Narrow sweet spot | Wide, even coverage |
| SPL drops off quickly with distance | SPL maintains across the space |
| Multiple speakers = phase issues | Diffuse waves reduce interference |
| Heavy cabinets | Lightweight panels |
| Expensive for coverage | Affordable to scale |

## What People Say

> "Everywhere seems like a sweet spot."

> "I always have to wear earplugs, but not with this sound."

> "It's like listening to quality headphones but from a PA system."

> "Best sound I have ever heard."

These aren't cherry-picked testimonials from audiophile forums. They're from real people at real parties — dancers, sound engineers, the friends who "never comment on audio."

## Open By Design

We publish our designs, not patents. Every build guide, parts list, and technical insight is shared openly. Because good sound shouldn't be gatekept.
