# Products & Designs

## Open Source. Open Hardware. Build Your Own.

We're not a traditional speaker company. We design DML systems, test them at real events, and publish everything. Our goal is to get these panels into the hands of DIY builders, party collectives, and anyone who wants better sound without the markup.

## System Sizing

A rough guide based on our tested deployments:

| Venue Size | Panels Needed | Exciter Power | Sub Pairing |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Small (50-100 people) | 4-8 panels (1-2 stacks) | 640W RMS total | 2× 18" subs |
| Medium (100-200 people) | 8-16 panels (2-4 stacks) | 1280W RMS total | 4× 18" subs |
| Large (200-400 people) | 16-24 panels (4-6 stacks) | 2500W+ RMS | 6-8× 18" subs |

Crossover at 90Hz. DML handles 100Hz+ naturally.

## Cost Comparison

| System | Approximate Cost | Coverage |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Quality line array element | €3,000-8,000+ each | Narrow dispersion |
| Tectonic DML500 | Premium (US import adds €€€) | Wide but expensive |
| Resonant Systems DIY panel | ~€200 each | Wide, affordable |

Build 16 panels for less than the cost of 2-3 conventional line array boxes — with better coverage.
