# Community

## This Isn't a Solo Project

DML technology has been developed by hundreds of experimenters, builders, and obsessives over years of forum threads, failed prototypes, and late-night listening sessions. Resonant Systems is just one node in that network.

We believe in open development. That means sharing what we learn and learning from what you share.

## The DIYAudio Thread

The mothership. 

The **DML PA Systems** thread on DIYAudio.com is where much of this started — technical discussion, experiments, measurements, failures, and breakthroughs. If you want to go deep on the physics, materials science, and real-world testing, this is where to find it.

**[→ DML PA Systems Thread (DIYAudio.com)](https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/dml-pa-systems.390363/)**

Key contributors have tested everything from honeycomb composites to paper-skinned foam, polycarb disc techniques for HF extension, and various exciter configurations. The collective knowledge there is immense.

## Get Help

Stuck on your build? Questions about materials, exciters, amplification?

**DIYAudio Thread:** Post your question — lots of experienced builders monitor it.

**Email:** leo@resonantsystems.eu — I try to respond to everyone, though it might take a few days.

**Common Questions:**
- What foam board should I use? → GPS/Neopor (graphite EPS), 25mm thick
- Which exciters? → Xcite XBT40/XT25 for quality, Dayton DAEX30HESF-4 for budget
- What amp? → Any decent class-D works. GaN amps are great. Budget: Sanway D2S
- How many panels for X size venue? → See our Products page for sizing guide

## Why Community Matters

> "In the end, with nothing else on the market, no one hears DML systems and no one demands them from the rental firms. So it seems to be up to DIY'ers to build some systems and get the word around!"

That's the mission. Build systems. Use them at events. Let people hear the difference. Talk about it.

Every builder who deploys DML at a party is a demo unit. Every dancefloor that sounds better is proof of concept. The more of us there are, the harder it becomes for the industry to ignore.

## Stay Connected

We're building out more community infrastructure:

- **Newsletter** — Build updates, community features, event deployments (coming soon)
- **Discord** — Maybe, if there's demand. Let us know.
- **GitHub** — Design files and documentation (in progress)

For now, the best way to stay connected is the DIYAudio thread and direct email.
