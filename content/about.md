# About

## This Started at a Party

I'm Leo. I throw parties. I also build things.

A few years ago, I was deep in a DIYAudio thread about distributed mode loudspeakers — panels that vibrate to produce sound instead of traditional cones. The physics intrigued me. Wide dispersion. Even coverage. No sweet spot. Everything you'd want for a dancefloor but can't get from conventional PA.

So I built some.

The first real test was at a festival in 2022. 200 people, 20×20 meter dancefloor, four corners of stacks I'd built from graphite foam and Dayton exciters. Cost me about €200 per speaker. The subs were rented L'Acoustics — proper kit — but the tops were my DIY panels.

I was nervous. The hired sound guy was skeptical.

> "We turned it on and without even tweaking the XO it just was way beyond expectation, sounding really loud and clear, and no problem to keep up with the subs, rather the other way around. Sound guy admitted he was very sceptical initially, and probably thought I was crazy not using his Kara tops instead, but admitted he was very impressed when he heard it."

That was the moment I knew this wasn't just a hobby project.

## The Feedback That Changed Everything

Throughout that night, people kept coming up to me. Not just the audio nerds — everyone. Comments I'd never heard before:

> "Everywhere seems like a sweet spot."

> "I always have to wear earplugs, but not with this sound."

> "It's like listening to quality headphones but from a PA system."

> "Best sound I have ever heard."

People who never talk about sound were talking about sound. Dancers weren't clustering in front of the stacks — they were spreading across the whole floor because the whole floor sounded good.

That's when I realized there's a gap in the market.

## The Gap

DML technology isn't new. But it's almost invisible in the PA world.

**Tectonic** makes commercial DML systems. Premium quality, premium price, and only in the US. Importing to Europe is brutal — expensive and slow.

Rental companies want familiar products. They're conservative. They stock what they know.

> "In the end, with nothing else on the market, no one hears DML systems and no one demands them from the rental firms. So it seems to be up to DIY'ers to build some systems and get the word around!"

So that's what I'm doing.

## Why Open?

I could patent this. I could gatekeep. I could build a company around proprietary designs and force everyone through my sales funnel.

I'm not going to.

Here's why:

**The technology is too good to hide.** People should hear what DML can do. Every party, every festival, every weird warehouse rave deserves better sound. If I hoard the knowledge, fewer systems get built, fewer people experience it.

**DIY builders make it better.** Some of the best improvements have come from the community. Andre Bellwood's polycarb disc technique for HF boost. Various coating experiments. Panel material discoveries. Open development is faster development.

**I'm not in this to get rich.** I throw parties. I like building things. I want better sound at events. If publishing designs helps that happen, even if other people build and sell similar systems, that's a win.

Resonant Systems publishes build guides, parts lists, and design files. We sell 3D printed parts and (eventually) complete kits for people who want convenience. But the core knowledge is free.

## What I Actually Believe

**Good PA doesn't require expensive PA.** The markup on commercial systems is insane. You can build better-sounding coverage for a fraction of the cost if you're willing to learn.

**Everyone should hear the difference.** Not just the people standing in the sweet spot. Not just the VIP section. Everyone.

**Sound matters more than specs.** I don't care about THD numbers in a lab. I care about what dancers say at 3am.

**Share what works.** Someone else's success isn't my failure. More DML systems in the world means more people demanding DML from rental companies, more manufacturers paying attention, more development, better sound for everyone.

## The Name

Resonant Systems. Because DML works *with* resonance instead of fighting it. And because the goal is systemic — not just one speaker, but a whole approach to sound.
