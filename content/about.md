## This Started at a Party

I'm Leo. I make music, DJ and throw parties. I also build things.

A few years ago, I came across a discussion about Distributed Mode Loudspeakers (DML) and became curious. A different way of generating sound where instead of pushing a cone you make a plate vibrate creating a pattern of vibrations resulting in a diffuse and phase-incoherent signal. 

I found it very fashinating because in many ways it is the opposite of what we think of as a good speaker, where we want to avoid resonances and phase incoherence, but at the same time it is the natual way in which sounds are generated in the real world. When you speak your chest is acting as a DML, and obviously acoustic instruments like violin or guitar works with the same principle. Our ears and brain are designed and attuned to handle that kind of diffuse signal, so to understand the whole picture you have to not only disregard what you know about conventional speakers, but also accept that while measurements and theory are important, they have to be applied taking psychoacoustics into consideration.

Initially I was thinking that it looks simple enough to construct and very inexpensive to try it out and maybe get a decent set of living room speakers out of it. But when I tried it I was instantly blown away. Sound felt much more open and encompassing, room reflections was much less of an issue and when pushing the speakers hard they still sounded clear and relaxed. I instantly got carried away thinking of the potential for a PA system. 

So I built some.

The first real test was at a festival in 2022. 200 people, 20×20 meter dancefloor, four corners of stacks I'd built from graphite foam and Dayton exciters. Cost me about €150 per speaker. The subs were rented L'Acoustics — proper kit — but the tops were my DIY panels.

I was nervous. The hired sound guy was skeptical.

> "We turned it on and without even tweaking the XO it just was way beyond expectation, sounding really loud and clear, and no problem to keep up with the subs, rather the other way around. Sound guy admitted he was very sceptical initially, and probably thought I was crazy not using his Kara tops instead, but admitted he was very impressed when he heard it."

That was the moment I knew this wasn't just a hobby project.

## The Feedback That Changed Everything

Throughout that night, people kept coming up to me. Not just the audio nerds — everyone. Comments I'd never heard before:

> "Everywhere seems like a sweet spot."

> "I always have to wear earplugs, but not with this sound."

> "It's like listening to quality headphones but from a PA system."

> "Best sound I have ever heard."

People who never talk about sound were talking about sound. Dancers weren't clustering in front of the stacks — they were spreading across the whole floor because the whole floor sounded good.

That's when I realized there's a gap in the market.

## The Gap

DML technology isn't new. But it's almost invisible in the PA world.

**Tectonic** made commercial DML systems. Premium quality, premium price, and only in the US.

Rental companies want familiar products. They're conservative. They stock what they know.

> "In the end, with nothing else on the market, no one hears DML systems and no one demands them from the rental firms. So it seems to be up to DIY'ers to build some systems and get the word around!"

So that's what I'm doing.

## Why Open?

I wan't DML to become established for PA use. I could build a company around proprietary designs and force everyone through my sales funnel.

I'm not going to.

Here's why:

**The technology is too good to hide.** People should hear what DML can do. Every party, every festival, every weird warehouse rave deserves better sound. If I hoard the knowledge, fewer systems get built, fewer people experience it.

**DIY builders make it better.** The DIY community around DML is amazing I owe everything to a few contributors in diyaudio forum knowledgable about material science, developing simulation software as well as experimenting with different designs, plate materials and coatings. Resonant Systems was boorn out of open development and will stay that way.

**I'm not in this to get rich.** I throw parties. I like building things. I want better sound at events. If publishing designs helps that happen, even if other people build and sell similar systems, that's a win.

Resonant Systems publishes build guides, parts lists, and design files. We sell 3D printed parts and (eventually) complete kits for people who want convenience. But the core knowledge is free.

**Share what works.** Someone else's success isn't my failure. More DML systems in the world means more people demanding DML from rental companies, more manufacturers paying attention, more development, better sound for everyone.

## The Name

Resonant Systems. Because DML works *with* resonance instead of fighting it. And because the goal is systemic — not just one speaker, but a whole approach to sound.

## Contact

I'm always happy to talk builds, answer questions, or hear about your events.
